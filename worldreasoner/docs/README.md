# WorldReasoner: Temporal Forecasting Benchmark for LLMs

WorldReasoner evaluates how AI language models perform on real-world prediction tasks when given structured, temporally-filtered evidence. The system addresses core limitations of LLMs as forecasters — training data cutoffs and lack of causal structure — by providing a temporal gateway that simulates a controlled "past" for each question, paired with an evidence pipeline that collects, structures, and quality-scores articles and causal event graphs. Benchmarking is conducted across six experimental conditions ranging from pure knowledge recall to full evidence-augmented reasoning, evaluated against a 120-question curated dataset sourced from Polymarket.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv sync && uv run playwright install
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml  # add API keys

# Collect and process questions
uv run wr question collect
uv run wr evidence run -q <question_id>
uv run wr graph build -q <question_id>

# Run a benchmark
uv run wr benchmark run -c vanilla_llm -n 10           # quick test
uv run wr benchmark run -c worldreasoner --question-ids include_ids.txt

# Score results (contamination-filtered, matches paper)
uv run wr benchmark evaluate \
  --db combined.db \
  --include-ids include_ids.txt \
  --filter-knowledge-leakage

# Research dashboard
uv run worldreasoner --reload &
cd frontend && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5173
```
